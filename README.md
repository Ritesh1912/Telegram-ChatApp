This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Prerequisites

1. Programming Languages:
- JavaScript : Essential for front-end development, interactive elements, and API interactions.
- HTML/CSS : Used for structuring web pages and styling the user interface.

2. Frameworks and Libraries:
- React, Redux : Front-end frameworks for building interactive user interfaces and managing state.
- sass : CSS pre-processor for responsive design and styling components.

3. Development Tools and Environment:
- Code Editor: Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom for writing and managing code.
- Version Control: Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and managing codebase changes.
- Package Managers: npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn for managing dependencies and packages.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): Familiarity with CLI for running scripts, installing packages, and managing project tasks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# Installation
Install my-project with npm

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
